# Journal Template
Just the template for the journal I use. It uses jekyll to generate a website and the entries become entries thereof. I don't post the actual entries here but it's a pretty fun theme-based project.

To use it just set up jekyll, clone the project, and run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`. All the entries are put in the `journal/_feed` directory. Could've had them put in `journal/_posts` but I was troubleshooting something and when I shifted over to another collection I couldn't be bothered to change it back.
